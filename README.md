# Warmup Mailserver

## Quick start

- Create a `settings.json` file ([see example](./settings.sample.json))

## About dataset

The original dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation and has been made public by the US government. You can find more informations on this page : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/.

The dataset downloaded by this software is a slightly modified one : the original csv file has been converted to sqlite and cleaned up.
